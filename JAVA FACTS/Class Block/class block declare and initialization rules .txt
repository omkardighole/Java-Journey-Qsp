Great follow-up: **“Why can’t we assign a value directly in the class body in Java?”**
Let’s answer this in **simple terms with internal logic**.

---

## 🔴 Problem Example (Invalid):

```java
class Test {
    static int x;
    x = 10; // ❌ NOT allowed here
}
```

---

## 🧠 **Why is this NOT allowed?**

### 🔹 1. **Java Class Body Only Allows Declarations — Not Statements**

The **class body** (outside of methods/blocks) is meant for:

✅ **Declarations** like:

```java
int a = 5;              // allowed
static String name = ""; // allowed
```

❌ **Statements** like:

```java
a = 5; // ❌ NOT allowed — it’s a statement, not a declaration
```

---

### 🔹 2. **Java Needs a Controlled Execution Context**

Statements like `x = 10;` must run **in a method, block, or constructor**, because Java needs to know **when and how** to execute them.

> A statement like `x = 10;` needs a runtime context (like `main()`, `static {}` block).
> Outside of these, Java has **no legal place** to execute it.

---

### 🔹 3. **Java Is Not a Scripting Language**

Languages like Python allow top-level statements.
But Java is a **strictly structured compiled language** — it separates:

| Code Type    | Allowed In                                   |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Declarations | Class body ✅                                 |
| Statements   | Method, constructor, block only ✅            |
| Assignments  | Must be part of a statement or declaration ✅ |

---

## ✅ Summary: Why It’s Not Allowed

| Reason                              | Explanation                                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Java separates declarations & logic | Declarations = OK; Statements = only inside methods/blocks   |
| Execution context is required       | `x = 10;` is a runtime statement, needs a scope              |
| Syntax rule enforced by compiler    | "illegal start of expression" or "identifier expected" error |

---

## ✅ Correct Alternatives:

```java
class Test {
    static int x = 10;           // ✅ declaration with assignment
    static { x = 10; }           // ✅ inside static block
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        x = 10;                  // ✅ inside method
    }
}
```
