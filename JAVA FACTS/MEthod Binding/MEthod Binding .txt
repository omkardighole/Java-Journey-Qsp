Yes ‚úÖ ‚Äî **binding can be influenced by the order of formal arguments** in **method overloading** and **polymorphism**, especially during **compile-time binding (static binding)**.

---

## üîç Let's break this down:

### ‚úÖ **What is binding?**

Binding refers to **linking a method call to the method definition**:

* **Early (static) binding**: Happens at compile time (e.g., method overloading)
* **Late (dynamic) binding**: Happens at runtime (e.g., method overriding with inheritance)

---

## ‚úÖ Scenario where **order of formal arguments matters**

### ‚úÖ Method Overloading

You can have multiple methods with the **same name but different argument order**:

```java
class Test {
    void show(int a, String b) {
        System.out.println("int, String");
    }

    void show(String a, int b) {
        System.out.println("String, int");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Test t = new Test();
        t.show(10, "Java");     // int, String ‚Üí matched by order
        t.show("Hello", 20);    // String, int ‚Üí matched by order
    }
}
```

### ‚úÖ Binding Happens:

* At **compile-time**, the compiler **matches the method call based on number, types, and order of parameters**.
* So yes, **order of formal arguments matters** in **overloading**.

---

### ‚ùå But Not in Method Overriding

In **runtime polymorphism**, method signatures must **exactly match**, including parameter order. There‚Äôs **no role of parameter order** in resolving which method to call ‚Äî it‚Äôs always based on **object type at runtime**, not method signature variety.

## üî• Interview Tip:

> **Can Java bind a method call using the order of arguments?**
> ‚úÖ **Yes, in method overloading (compile-time binding).**
> ‚ùå **No, in method overriding (runtime binding).**

## ‚úÖ Summary Table

| Concept              | Is binding based on argument order? | Type of Binding | Notes                        |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Method Overloading   | ‚úÖ Yes                               | Compile-time    | Signature includes order     |
| Method Overriding    | ‚ùå No                                | Runtime         | Signature must match exactly |
| Constructor Overload | ‚úÖ Yes                               | Compile-time    | Same as method overloading   |
| Varargs Overload     | ‚úÖ Yes                               | Compile-time    | If ambiguous, compiler error |
