Sure! Let’s focus on the **`static block`** in Java — explained in **simple words** with examples and memory flow.

---

## ✅ What is a **Static Block**?

A **static block** is a block of code that:

* Runs **once**, when the **class is loaded**.
* Used to **initialize static variables**.
* Runs **before `main()`**, and before any object is created.

---

### 🔹 Syntax:

```java
static {
    // your code here
}
```

---

## 📌 Example:

```java
class Test {
    static int x;

    static {
        System.out.println("Static block is running");
        x = 100;  // initializing static variable
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Main method starts");
        System.out.println("x = " + x);
    }
}
```

### ✅ Output:

```
Static block is running
Main method starts
x = 100
```

## 🔁 Flow:

| Step | What Happens           | Memory Area | Who Does It |
| ---- | ---------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1    | Class `Test` is loaded | Method Area | JVM         |
| 2    | 🔥 Static block runs   | Method Area | JVM         |
| 3    | `main()` runs          | Stack       | JVM         |

## ❓ Why Use Static Block?

| Use Case                    | Example                    |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Initialize static variables | `x = 100;`                 |
| Connect to a database once  | `static { connectDB(); }`  |
| Load configuration file     | `static { loadConfig(); }` |
| Logging setup at class load | `static { logInit(); }`    |

---

## ⚠️ Important Points:

* Can be **multiple static blocks** – they run **top to bottom**.
* **Only runs once** — when the class is loaded into memory.
* Runs **before** `main()` or any object is created.

---

### 🧠 Summary:

> A **static block** is a special block that **runs only once** to **initialize static parts of a class** before anything else happens.
