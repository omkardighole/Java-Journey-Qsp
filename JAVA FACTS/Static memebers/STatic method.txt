### 🔄 1. **`main()` is a static method – but why?**

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // entry point of every Java program
}
```

➡ Java needs to run your program **without creating an object**, so `main()` must be `static`.
If it weren’t, the JVM would need to create an object first—which it can't do without a starting method.

---

### ♻️ 2. **Static blocks run before `main()`**

```java
class Demo {
    static {
        System.out.println("Static block runs before main!");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Main method");
    }
}
```

📌 Output:

```
Static block runs before main!
Main method
```

➡ Static blocks are great for **initial setup** before any code runs.

---

### 👥 3. **All objects share static data**

```java
class Counter {
    static int count = 0;

    Counter() {
        count++;
        System.out.println(count);
    }
}
```

➡ `count` is shared by all objects. So:

```java
new Counter(); // 1
new Counter(); // 2
new Counter(); // 3
```

➡ Only **one copy of `count`** exists, shared across all instances.

---

### 🔒 4. **Static methods can be `private`, `public`, or `protected`**

```java
class MyClass {
    private static void hidden() {
        System.out.println("Private static method");
    }
}
```

➡ `static` can be combined with **any access modifier**. Even private static methods are common in utility classes.

---

### 🏗️ 5. **Used in Utility / Helper Classes**

```java
int max = Math.max(10, 20);
```

➡ Classes like `Math`, `Collections`, `Arrays`, `Integer`, etc. use static methods so you can **reuse common logic** without creating objects.

---

### 🚫 6. **Static methods can't access non-static members directly**

```java
class Example {
    int x = 5;

    static void printX() {
        // System.out.println(x); ❌ Not allowed
    }
}
```

➡ You must create an object:

```java
Example obj = new Example();
System.out.println(obj.x); ✅
```

---

### 🧬 7. **Static Nested Classes**

```java
class Outer {
    static class Inner {
        void message() {
            System.out.println("Inside static nested class");
        }
    }
}
```

➡ Static nested classes **don't need an object of the outer class**.

```java
Outer.Inner obj = new Outer.Inner();
obj.message();
```

Used in **frameworks** like Spring, JavaFX, etc.

---

### 👨‍👦 8. **Static methods are not truly overridden (they are hidden)**

```java
class Parent {
    static void show() {
        System.out.println("Parent");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    static void show() {
        System.out.println("Child");
    }
}
```

```java
Parent obj = new Child();
obj.show();  // Output: Parent ❗
```

➡ Because static methods are resolved using the **reference type**, not the object.

---

### 🔁 9. **Static methods can be overloaded**

```java
class Overload {
    static void display() {
        System.out.println("No args");
    }

    static void display(String msg) {
        System.out.println(msg);
    }
}
```

➡ Overloading works based on different **parameter lists**.

---

### 🔧 10. **Used in Factory Methods (like `List.of()`)**

```java
List<String> names = List.of("Alice", "Bob");
```

➡ Static factory methods are common in APIs to create objects **without `new` keyword**.

---

### 📦 11. **Stored in Method Area (not Heap)**

Static methods and static variables are stored in a special part of memory called the **method area**, not inside the heap like instance variables.

---

### ⚡ 12. **Faster Execution (no dynamic dispatch)**

Since the method call is resolved at **compile time**, there's no overhead like virtual method dispatch, making static calls slightly **faster** than instance method calls.

➡️➡️➡️➡️What exactly is the “method reference” stored in the class's method area?
In other words, what is "that reference" pointing to?

✅ Short Answer:
The reference stored in the class's method area for a static method is a pointer (or symbolic link) to the method's bytecode, along with its signature, stored in the constant pool and method table.

🧠 Internally, “method reference” includes:
Method Name – e.g., "display"

Method Signature – e.g., "(Ljava/lang/String;)V"

Pointer to Bytecode – memory address or index where the method's instructions are stored

So when we say "method reference", it means:

"Here’s a unique key that identifies the method's name, its argument types, return type, and where its instructions live in memory."

🔍 Example:
Given this method:

java
Copy
Edit
class Demo {
    static void greet(String name) {
        System.out.println("Hello " + name);
    }
}
Internally, the method area holds something like:

📂 Constant Pool Entries:
Entry #	Type	Value
1	Utf8	"greet"
2	Utf8	"(Ljava/lang/String;)V"
3	MethodRef	Class: Demo, Name+Type: (1,2)

🧾 Method Table (internal structure):
Name	Signature	Pointer / Address
greet	(Ljava/lang/String;)V	→ 0x004F (bytecode address)

So the reference stored is:

MethodRef #3 = "greet(String):void"

Points to 0x004F in bytecode → JVM jumps there to execute when Demo.greet("Omkar") is called.

🏗️ Why store a reference and not direct code?
Because:

It allows lazy resolution: methods are resolved only when needed.

Makes dynamic linking possible.

Keeps things modular and efficient.

🛠️ Summary: What is “that reference”?
Part	What it Means
Method Reference	Symbolic entry in constant pool (MethodRef)
Points To	Method name, signature, and bytecode location
Stored In	Class’s Method Area
Used For	Invoking the correct method when called
