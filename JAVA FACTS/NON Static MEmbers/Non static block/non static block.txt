# 🔍 **Java Non-Static Initialization Block (NSIB)**

📚 *Oracle-Inspired Complete Guide*

---

## ✅ **Definition (Oracle-Based)**

> A **non-static block** (or instance initializer block) is a block of code enclosed in `{}` that **executes every time an object is created**, **before the constructor runs**, and **after instance variables are initialized**.
> 📘 [Oracle Official Docs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/initial.html)

---

## 🧠 **Syntax**

```java
class MyClass {
    // Non-static block
    {
        System.out.println("Non-static block");
    }

    MyClass() {
        System.out.println("Constructor");
    }
}
```

### 🔄 Output:

```
Non-static block  
Constructor
```

## 🧠 **Memory Behavior (JVM Internals)**

| Component             | Location                     | Timing                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Object (`this`)       | Heap                         | Created at `new`                    |
| Non-static block code | Class bytecode → Method Area | Compiled once                       |
| Stack frame           | Stack                        | Created per method/constructor call |

* JVM internally **copies the non-static block's code** into every constructor **at the beginning** during compilation.
* So the **non-static block runs before constructor body**, but after instance variable initialization.

---

## 🔁 **Execution Flow**

```java
class Demo {
    int x = 5;

    {
        System.out.println("Non-static block");
    }

    Demo() {
        System.out.println("Constructor");
    }
}
```

### 💡 Execution Order:

1. Memory allocated on Heap
2. Instance variables initialized
3. **Non-static block executes**
4. Constructor runs

---

## 📌 **Use Cases of Non-Static Block**

| Use Case                       | Description                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Common object setup logic      | Avoid repeating code in all constructors                |
| Instance-level logging         | Log object creation metadata                            |
| Anonymous or initializer logic | Run setup code before constructor without extra methods |
| Field validation               | Initialize instance variables with custom rules         |

---

## ✅ **Real-World Code Example**

```java
class Account {
    int accountId;
    double balance;

    {
        accountId = (int)(Math.random() * 10000);
        balance = 500.0;
        System.out.println("Account setup completed.");
    }

    Account() {
        System.out.println("Default constructor");
    }

    Account(double balance) {
        this.balance = balance;
        System.out.println("Parameterized constructor");
    }
}
```

### 🔄 Output:

```bash
Account setup completed.
Default constructor

Account setup completed.
Parameterized constructor
```

## ⚠️ **Tricky Interview Questions & Scenarios**

| Question                                         | Answer                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Can you use `this` in a non-static block?        | ✅ Yes, because object already exists                   |
| Can non-static blocks access instance variables? | ✅ Yes                                                  |
| Do non-static blocks execute for every object?   | ✅ Yes, before every constructor                        |
| Can we have multiple non-static blocks?          | ✅ Yes, executes **top to bottom** in declaration order |
| Is it a good practice?                           | ❌ Not always. Use constructors unless logic is shared  |

---

## 🔄 **Multiple Non-Static Blocks Example**

```java
class Example {
    {
        System.out.println("Block 1");
    }

    {
        System.out.println("Block 2");
    }

    Example() {
        System.out.println("Constructor");
    }
}
```

### 🔄 Output:

```
Block 1  
Block 2  
Constructor
```

---

## 🧠 **Behind the Scenes (JVM Translation)**

```java
class Test {
    {
        System.out.println("Init Block");
    }

    Test() {
        System.out.println("Constructor");
    }
}
```

⬇️ **JVM internally translates to:**

```java
Test() {
    System.out.println("Init Block"); // non-static block injected here
    System.out.println("Constructor");
}
```

## 🔄 NSIB vs Static Block

| Feature                        | Non-Static Block                          | Static Block             |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Belongs to                     | Instance                                  | Class                    |
| Executes                       | On object creation                        | When class loads         |
| Can access instance variables? | ✅ Yes                                     | ❌ No                     |
| Can access static variables?   | ✅ Yes                                     | ✅ Yes                    |
| Frequency                      | Every time `new` is called                | Only once per class load |
| Stored in                      | Method Area (code), Heap (object runs it) | Method Area              |

---

## ✅ Summary Table

| Feature           | Non-Static Block                             |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Keyword           | No keyword – just `{}` inside class          |
| When it runs      | After instance variables, before constructor |
| Can access `this` | ✅ Yes                                        |
| Frequency         | Executes **every time an object is created** |
| Multiple blocks   | ✅ Allowed – run top to bottom                |
| Internal behavior | Copied into constructor body at compile time |
| Purpose           | Common logic across all constructors         |

---

## ✅ Final Thought: When to Use Non-Static Blocks?

Use **non-static blocks** only when:

* You want to initialize common logic across multiple constructors.
* You want lightweight pre-constructor initialization.
* You **don't want to copy/paste code** in every constructor.

✅ But for most real-world development: **prefer constructors or methods** over non-static blocks for clarity and maintainability.

| NSIB inside anonymous classes or inheritance            | ❌      | ❗ **Not Yet** (see below)           |

---

### 🆕 Let's Cover What Was Missing:

---

## ⚠️ 1. **What if Exception Occurs in Non-Static Block?**

```java
class Test {
    {
        int x = 5 / 0; // ArithmeticException
    }

    Test() {
        System.out.println("Constructor");
    }
}
```

### 🔄 Output:

```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
```

➡ **Constructor is never executed**.
➡ Object creation fails if an exception is thrown inside the non-static block.

📌 **Rule**: NSIB exceptions will stop object creation unless caught internally using `try-catch`.

---

## ⚠️ 2. **Non-Static Block in Inheritance (Superclass/Subclass)**

```java
class A {
    {
        System.out.println("A's non-static block");
    }
    A() {
        System.out.println("A's constructor");
    }
}

class B extends A {
    {
        System.out.println("B's non-static block");
    }
    B() {
        System.out.println("B's constructor");
    }
}
```

### 🔄 Output:

```
A's non-static block  
A's constructor  
B's non-static block  
B's constructor
```

🧠 **Order of Execution in Inheritance**:

1. Superclass instance vars → Superclass NSIB → Superclass constructor
2. Subclass instance vars → Subclass NSIB → Subclass constructor

---

## ⚠️ 3. **Can We Have Non-Static Block in Anonymous Class?**

Yes ✅

```java
Runnable r = new Runnable() {
    {
        System.out.println("Non-static block in anonymous class");
    }

    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Run method");
    }
};
```

➡ Yes, NSIB executes when object of anonymous class is created.

Great! Let’s test your understanding with a **Java Non-Static Block Quiz** — covering **basic to tricky** levels, exactly how interviewers might ask.

---

## 🧪 **Java Non-Static Block Quiz (with Answers + Explanations)**

---

### 🔹 **Q1. What is the main purpose of a non-static block in Java?**

**A.** To execute code at class load time
**B.** To execute code every time an object is created
**C.** To initialize static variables
**D.** To override constructors

✅ **Correct Answer:** **B**
🧠 *Non-static block runs every time an object is created, before the constructor.*

---

### 🔹 **Q2. What is the correct execution order in object creation?**

**A.** Constructor → Non-static block → Instance variable
**B.** Non-static block → Constructor → Instance variable
**C.** Instance variable → Non-static block → Constructor
**D.** Static block → Constructor → Non-static block

✅ **Correct Answer:** **C**
🧠 *1) Instance vars, 2) Non-static block, 3) Constructor*

---

### 🔹 **Q3. Can a non-static block access `this` keyword?**

**A.** No, because object isn’t created
**B.** Yes, because it executes after object is created
**C.** Only inside constructors
**D.** Only inside static methods

✅ **Correct Answer:** **B**
🧠 *Non-static block executes after object creation, so `this` is available.*

---

### 🔹 **Q4. What happens if an exception is thrown in a non-static block?**

**A.** Constructor still executes
**B.** Program skips that block and continues
**C.** Object creation fails
**D.** JVM restarts the program

✅ **Correct Answer:** **C**
🧠 *If an uncaught exception is thrown, object construction fails.*

---

### 🔹 **Q5. How many non-static blocks can a class have?**

**A.** Only 1
**B.** Up to 2
**C.** Unlimited
**D.** None

✅ **Correct Answer:** **C**
🧠 *A class can have **multiple** non-static blocks. They run **in order**.*

---

### 🔹 **Q6. What’s the behavior of non-static block in inheritance?**

**A.** Only child class’s block executes
**B.** Parent then child blocks execute
**C.** Constructor executes before block
**D.** Blocks don’t execute in inheritance

✅ **Correct Answer:** **B**
🧠 *Superclass NSIB runs first, then subclass NSIB.*

---

### 🔹 **Q7. Where is non-static block code stored in memory?**

**A.** Stack
**B.** Heap
**C.** Method Area
**D.** PermGen

✅ **Correct Answer:** **C**
🧠 *NSIB is part of class bytecode, so stored in **Method Area**.*

---

### 🔹 **Q8. Which of these is a bad practice?**

**A.** Using NSIB for shared logic across constructors
**B.** Using NSIB instead of constructor for full object setup
**C.** Using NSIB to assign default values
**D.** None

✅ **Correct Answer:** **B**
🧠 *Full setup logic should ideally be done in constructors for readability.*

---

### 🔹 **Q9. Which of the following is NOT true about NSIB?**

**A.** It executes before the constructor
**B.** It can use `this`
**C.** It only executes once per class
**D.** It’s copied into constructor by compiler

✅ **Correct Answer:** **C**
🧠 *Static blocks run once per class; **NSIB runs for each object**.*

---

### 🔹 **Q10. What is the output of the following?**

```java
class A {
    {
        System.out.println("Block");
    }

    A() {
        System.out.println("Constructor");
    }
}
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new A();
    }
}
```

**A.** Constructor
**B.** Block
**C.** Block → Constructor
**D.** Constructor → Block

✅ **Correct Answer:** **C**
🧠 *Non-static block always executes before the constructor.*
