Excellent! Let's now explain **non-static methods in Java** **as per the official Oracle documentation**, and align all points with Oracle’s terminology and behavior:

---

## ✅ What is a Non-Static Method?

📖 **Oracle Java SE Docs (JLS 8.4.3: Instance Methods):**

> *"An instance method is invoked with respect to an instance of a class, and has access to the fields of that instance."*

---

### 🔹 Oracle-Style Definition:

> A **non-static method** (also called an **instance method**) belongs to the **instances (objects)** of a class. It is called using an object reference and can **access instance (non-static) and static members** of the class.

## 🧠 Oracle-Based Behavior Summary:

| Feature          | Oracle Behavior                                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Access           | Must be invoked on an instance (object)                                                                          |
| `this` Reference | Always available and refers to the current object instance                                                       |
| Can Access       | Instance fields, static fields, instance methods, and static methods                                             |
| Inheritance      | Yes, instance methods are **subject to overriding** and polymorphism                                             |
| Invocation       | `objectRef.methodName()`                                                                                         |
| Memory           | Method code resides in **method area**, but it **executes in stack**, with `this` referencing object on **heap** |
| Default Modifier | If no modifier is specified, method is package-private (default access)                                          |
| Lifecycle        | Runs **only after object creation**, each call is bound to the **calling object**                                |

---

## 📘 From Oracle JLS (Java Language Specification):

> **"If a method is not declared static, then it is an instance method, and implementation of the method may reference the current object using `this`."**

> — [JLS §8.4.3](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.4.3)

---

## 🔄 Execution Behavior (As per Oracle JVM Spec):

When calling a non-static method:

1. JVM pushes a new **stack frame** for the method.
2. JVM passes the **object reference** (this) as the first hidden parameter.
3. Instance fields and methods can be used via `this`.

---

## ✅ Oracle-Compatible Code Example:

```java
public class OracleStyleDemo {
    int count = 5; // instance variable

    void show() { // non-static method
        System.out.println("this.count = " + this.count); // uses this
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OracleStyleDemo obj = new OracleStyleDemo();
        obj.show(); // call using object
    }
}
```

## 🔍 Official Terms Used by Oracle:

| Oracle Term                      | Meaning in Context                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Instance Method**              | A method that is **not static** and is associated with an object     |
| **Receiver (`this`)**            | Hidden parameter referring to the object used to invoke the method   |
| **Method Invocation Expression** | Syntax like `obj.method()`                                           |
| **Member Access**                | Instance methods can access both **instance** and **static** members |

## ❗ Oracle-Implied Rules

| Rule                                               | Source                         |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Cannot call instance method without an object      | JLS §15.12: Method Invocation  |
| `this` is available only inside non-static methods | JLS §15.8.3: `this` Expression |
| Instance methods can be overridden                 | JLS §8.4.8: Method Overriding  |
| Static methods cannot override instance methods    | JLS §8.4.8.1: Overriding Rules |

## 🧠 Summary (Oracle-Oriented View)

| Feature            | Non-Static Method                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ownership          | Belongs to **instances of the class**                   |
| Access             | Using `object.method()` syntax                          |
| Access to fields   | ✅ Instance & ✅ Static                                   |
| Access to `this`   | ✅ Yes, auto-passed by JVM                               |
| Memory & Execution | Code: method area, Reference: heap, Execution: stack    |
| Override Support   | ✅ Yes — polymorphism applicable                         |
| Hidden Parameters  | JVM passes `this` as hidden argument internally         |
| Oracle Definition  | *"Invoked with respect to an instance..."* — JLS §8.4.3 |

## 📝 Conclusion (in Oracle’s words):

> **"A non-static method is one which must be invoked with respect to an object and has access to the instance fields and methods of that object."**

This matches exactly how `this` works and how memory and execution behave under JVM guidelines as per the Oracle specifications.
